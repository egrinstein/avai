# AVAI - Audio Visual AI

This repository contains the AVAI project code, developed within the Code/Stage Hackathon hosted by Sony Music in November 2020.

Our application is a playlist recommendation system based on images.
We infer the context of the users' ambiance through image analysis using Deep Learning (AWS' Amazon Rekognition service), and recommend them a correspondig playlist.

## Testing
The application ~~can be accessed at http://audio-visual-ai.herokuapp.com/~~ needs to be redeployed.

We have provide some test images (creative commons) in the `test_images` folder in this repository, which can be used to test the functionality of the project.

## Code
The "avai_app" folder is a django app which contains most of the code.
